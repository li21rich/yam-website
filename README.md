FOR FUTURE YAM DEVELOPERS:

To run the code:
```
git clone https://github.com/li21rich/yam-website.git
npm install
npm start
```

 <br /> <br /> <br />

If you choose to make a clone of this repo to make your own version and updates, you can edit in your IDE after installing, then make edits, and set up netlify with this github repo. After, run: 
```
cd yam-website
npm run deploy
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push
```
* you may need to run "set CI=false" in the terminal before deploying.
