FOR FUTURE YAM DEVELOPERS:

To run the code:
```
git clone https://github.com/li21rich/yam-website.git
npm install
npm start
```

 <br /> <br /> <br />

If you choose to separately clone this repo and make your own repo with updates, you would set up netlify with this github repo and then run: 
```
cd yam-website
npm run deploy
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push
```
* you may need to run "set CI=false" in the terminal before deploying.
