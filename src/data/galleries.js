The title incorporates “LOST” and the Greek reference to the crescent moon, symbolizing empowerment and transformation. Using natural and celestial elements, I explored positive and negative space to mirror my emotional journey. Colors enhance specific moments, guiding the viewer and emphasizing key themes of growth and renewal. As my feelings transitioned from feeling \"LOST\" to \"Blossom[ing] in the Crescent Moon,\" I discovered the strength in self-acceptance and embracing uncertainty.",

The outward markmaking on my face draws attention to ripples, symbolizing the lingering emotional aftershocks that continue to shape my sense of identity and belonging. In comparison, the light breaking through the curtains and reflecting on my face signifies clarity, underscoring the importance of facing these memories, no matter how painful or unclear, as a crucial step toward healing.",

    description: "In my process, I was interested in how highlights using white color pencil can be accentuated on a toned paper surface, so I used black and white color pencil to shade up a composition where a mannequin was turned away from a lamp while sitting on a vase. The inanimate object poses away from the light in a humanistic way, intended to evoke thought about what the ambiguous scene may represent. As I drew, I realized I could add a focus by using vibrant blues and greens for the fallen vase, so that the eyes are first drawn towards the iridescent green vase, then led up towards the mannequin. In my composition, I tried to maintain a ratio following the rule of thirds to make it more appealing to the eye."

When I started creating this piece, I did not have any plans or ideas. Instead, I started by laying blocks of color on the blank canvas and going with the flow. I used this painting to portray the chaotic nature of the mind as the thoughts move rapidly and often without any clear direction.",

      "This piece titled “Current” is roughly 22×30 inches and it is for graduating an art studio I’ve gone to for a large part of my life. It is a mixed media piece with marker, pastel, watercolor, acrylic, ink, and gold leaf. The girl in the middle symbolizes who I am. To break it down, her dress merges into my old art pieces and a wolf’s tail, meaning that my past struggles and effort is always part of what my art is today. You can see her drawing the end of the wolf’s tail— which symbolizes that despite artistic expression being such a scary thing for me, it also protects me and makes me feel comfortable and safe. A lot of the other smaller components are for visuals. This piece took me around 15 hours, and it really emphasizes that artists use a ton of effort to create something they’re proud of and it takes years for them to build themselves up in order to be proud and keep improving. It challenges the misconception that art is easy and effortless and really points out the journey an artist takes.",

It is an oil painting that is meant to display a futuristic, ethereal concept, characterized by high saturation and vibrance. The artist in the painting, Kim Lip, debuted 6th out of all 12 members with the hit-single, “Eclipse,” a K R&B masterpiece. The painting is aesthetically regal in order to match the concept of this particular member. She is engulfed in a warm lighting which is a reference to her representative color, red.",

I believe that applying knowledge from real-life to paper is important because it helps you identify unique characteristics that a person might possess, helps you to identify simple structures of the face, learn human proportions, and learn about the reflection of light/shadows. I also believe that shading is a challenge in the art world because it comes in many forms and is one of the most important elements that help bring your art piece to life and emulate the structure of your piece.",

My artwork includes utility poles falling and the adult elephants blocks it from hitting the baby. This artwork symbolizes that people grow and come to realize they are responsible for more things they never have to care about as a child. A child depends on others to be protected and is unaware of dangers. Overtime, they will have to take over their parent’s job of protecting a child. Everyone will come to a time when there are people or things that they love and cherish, and that is when they learn about responsibilities and protection.",

Why are we allowed to do and say certain things as a child but not as a teenager or adult - what does innocence excuse?  Is knowledge always power? Or does it blind us to the freedom of exploration? ... I want the viewer to believe they can once again unleash their mind to the vast realm of possibility. We may not be able to regain innocence and discard knowledge, but we can inspire ourselves to dream once more.",

        You are granted. <br />

        You should be granted to every human being the moment they descend onto

        deserves. <br />

        what my teacher used to say when I wouldn't respond to the
        mispronunciation of my name. There's nothing to take for granted,
        because, well, I was granted nothing. <br />
        <br />I am here, scrounging around with nothing but the change in my
        pocket and the hope in my heart, looking for you. I am here, seeking to
        find you, all by myself. I am here, on a path of self-discovery, trying
        to locate the vital thing I need to make my life worth living. <br />

        be. Among the blue uniforms, shiny badges, and armed black waistbands.
        Correcting the wrong, trapping the bad, removing the evil. Inside the
        gray building, with its unforgiving, sharp edges, sterile glass windows,
        and manicured front lawn. After all these miles and all this time, is
        this the place that I've been waiting for? <br />
        <br />I am here, waiting for you. No matter how hard I must fight, or
        how demeaning the pain is to endure, I will remain at this very place,
        anticipating the day you come. <br />
        <br />
        You may be written on paper or talked about by our leaders, but that is
        not enough. You must be embedded into the people and be at the core of
        our beings. <br />
        <br />
        The consciousness is leaving my body, the lethargy is taking over. I am
        stuck, not an ounce of energy left. I reach and reach, but there's
